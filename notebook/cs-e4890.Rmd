# CS-E4890 – Jigsaw Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification

## Abstract


## Introduction

The goal of this project is to attempt to solve a toxicity classification problem in the field of natural language processing (NLP). The approach used in this paper discusses neural networks and how they perform for this classification task. We discuss our reasoning, expectations and thoughts of the execution of our project. The toxicity classification problem at hand is due to the increasing amount of discussion platforms such as, comment feeds on live broadcasts and other forums. Some live broadcasts are targeted for wide audiences and need efficient, near instantanious, profanity filtering.

Typically, the issue with naïve profanity filtering is focusing too heavily on individual words and ignoring the context. It was studied that names of the frequently attacked identities were automatically accociated to toxicity by machine learning (ML) models, even if the individual(s) themselves, or the context, were not offensive. (Kaggle. 2019) 

In this paper, the overall assessment of the goodness of our model is deviced with an overall Area under the curve (AUC) Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) test and with multiple other submetrics. The submetrics are:
- Bias AUCs: To prevent unintended bias we use three specific subsets of the test for each identity, attemping to capture all the aspects of unintended bias.
     - Subgroup AUC: Focuses on specific identity subgroup
     - Background Positive, Subgroup negative (BSPSN) AUC: Evaluates only non-toxic examples for an identity and toxic examples without the identity
     - Background Negative, Subgroup positive (BNSP) AUC: The test set is restricted opposite to BSPN, only featuring examples of toxic examples of an identity and non-toxic examples without the identity
- Generalized Mean of Bias AUCs
    - Calculates the combination of the per-identity Bias AUCs into one overall measure with:
$$M_p(m_s) = \left(\frac{1}{N} \sum_{s=1}^{N} m_s^p\right)^\frac{1}{p}$$
where:
- $M_p$ = the pth power-mean function
- $m_s$ = the bias metric m calulated for subgroup s
- $N$ = number of identity subgroups


Lastly, after obtaining the overall AUC and the General Mean of Bias AUCs the calculation of the final model is done with formula:
$$score = w_0 AUC_{overall} + \sum_{a=1}^{A} w_a M_p(m_{s,a})$$
where:
- $A$ = number of submetrics (3)
- $m_s,a$ = bias metric for identity subgroup $s$ using submetric $a$
- $w_a$ = a weighting for the relative importance of each submetric; all four $w$ values set to 0.25

## Analysing the datasets
The origin of the data is from year 2017 when the Civil Comments platform shut down and published their ~2m public comments making them available for researchers. Each item in the dataset  has one primary attribute for the toxicity, `target`, indicating a goal value that the models should try to achieve. The trained model should then predict the `target` toxicity for the test data.

In addition to `target`, there are several subtypes of toxicity. These are not supposed to be predicted by the model, but they are for providing additional avenue for future research. The subtype attributes are:
- severe_toxicity
- obscene
- threat
- insult
- identity_attack
- sexual_explicit

Along with these, we may use attribute `parent_id` for training our model. The reason for this is that we think that the neural network should mark some difference between comments that start a thread versus ones that do not.

Some of the comments have a label for identity. There are multiple identity attributes, each representing the identity that is mentioned in the comment. The identities we are interested, as the ones used in the validation of the model, are:
- male
- female
- homosexuality_gay_or_lesbian
- christian
- jewish
- muslim
- black
- white
- psychiatric_or_mental_illness

Based on these, we decided to select the following columns for training the model and drop all other columns:

```{python}
identity_columns = [
    "male",
    "female",
    "homosexual_gay_or_lesbian",
    "christian",
    "jewish",
    "muslim",
    "black",
    "white",
    "psychiatric_or_mental_illness"
]

relevant_columns = [
    "id",
    "target",
    "comment_text"
] + identity_columns
```

### Cleaning up the data

The dataset contains duplicate comments with same content. However, the different comments may have been labelled with different targets or subgroups [kaggle].

The operations we do for the datasets are; lowercase the words, remove the non-alpha characters, fill empty values with 0 and preprocess the data so that we obtain a much smaller, more compact, sets for the training and validation.

```{python}
def create_cleaned_file(from_name, to_name, cols, drop_duplicates):
    """Create a cleaned file from a file"""
    data = pd.read_csv(
        f"../input/jigsaw-unintended-bias-in-toxicity-classification/{from_name}.csv",
        usecols=cols,# use only relevant columns, as specified before in the notebook
    )
    data.set_index("id", inplace=True)

    _, original_word_count = get_individual_words(data["comment_text"])

    # Remove all non-alphanumeric or space characters from comment text
    data["comment_text"] = data["comment_text"].transform(lambda s: re.sub("[^a-z\d\s]", " ", s.lower()))
    data = data.fillna(0) # fill empty values with 0

    if drop_duplicates:
        cleaned_words = set()
        data["comment_text"].str.split().apply(cleaned_words.update)

        # Write summary file of the cleanup process
        pd.DataFrame({
            "previous_word_count": [original_word_count],
            "cleaned_word_count": [get_individual_words(data["comment_text"])[1]],
            "previous_row_count": [len(data)],
            "cleaned_row_count": [data['comment_text'].nunique()]
        }).to_csv("./"+to_name+"_summary.csv")
        
        data = data.groupby('comment_text').mean().reset_index()
    data.to_csv("./"+to_name+".csv")

def print_cleanup_summary(filename):
    # read cleanup summary from saved file
    cleanup_summary = pd.read_csv("./"+filename+"_summary.csv")
    initial_row_count, initial_word_count = cleanup_summary.loc[
        0,
        ["previous_row_count", "previous_word_count"]
    ]
    cleaned_row_count, cleaned_word_count = cleanup_summary.loc[
        cleanup_summary.index[-1],
        ["cleaned_row_count", "cleaned_word_count"]
    ]

    print("The original data was reducted by {} rows ({:.2f}%) and by {} words ({:.2f}%)".format( 
        initial_row_count - cleaned_row_count,
        100 * (1 - cleaned_row_count / initial_row_count),
        initial_word_count - cleaned_word_count,
        100 * (1 - cleaned_word_count / initial_word_count)
    ))
    
def read_cleaned_file(from_name, to_name, cols = None, drop_duplicates = True):
    if not os.path.isfile("./"+to_name+".csv"):
        create_cleaned_file(from_name, to_name, cols, drop_duplicates)
    # read data from cleaned data file if not already set
    return  pd.read_csv("./"+to_name+".csv")
```

```{python}
print("reading train data...")
train_data = read_cleaned_file(
    'train',
    'train_cleaned',
    relevant_columns # discards all other columns
)
print_cleanup_summary("train_cleaned")


print("reading test data...")
test_data = read_cleaned_file(
    'test', 
    'test_cleaned', 
    drop_duplicates = False # we don't want to drop duplicates, as every comment in test_data have to be labelled
)
```

### Visualizations of the data

```{python}
visualize_toxicity_by_identity(train_data, identity_columns)
```

```{python}
train_data.sort_values(by=["target", "jewish"], ascending=False).head(10)
```

> ## Methods

Natural language processing (NLP) is an example of a Supervised Machine Learning task that focuses in labelled datasets containing sequences and or single words. The purpose of NLP is to train a classifier that can distinguish the sets of words into their right belonging categories (classes).

Typically the text classification pipeline contains the following components:
- Training data: Input text for the model
- Feature vector: A vector that describe the input texts, in some charasteristic or multiple ones
- Labels: The classes that we plan to predict with our trained model
- Algorithm: A machine learning algorithm that is used to classify the inputs
- Model: The result of the training, this will perform the label predictions ( https://medium.com/jatana/report-on-text-classification-using-cnn-rnn-han-f0e887214d5f )

A prime example of a text classification problem is detection of spam or toxic sentences.

Use of recursive neural networks (RNN) in natural language processing (NLP) is an intuitive and an advisable method. (**SOURCE**) RNNs exceed in grammar learning as the order of words may have an effect on the context of the sentence. This is mainly because their ability to process sequences of inputs, such as, in the case of toxicity filtering, sequences of words.


```{python}
train_x = train_data["comment_text"]
train_y = train_data[["target"] + identity_columns]

test_x = test_data["comment_text"]
```

### Preprocess the data

```{python}
sentences = train_x.append(test_x)

tokenizer = preprocessing.text.Tokenizer()
tokenizer.fit_on_texts(sentences)

max_len = len(sentences.max())

train_tokens = preprocessing.sequence.pad_sequences(
    tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(train_x),
    maxlen = max_len,
)
test_tokens = preprocessing.sequence.pad_sequences(
    tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(test_x),
    maxlen = max_len,
)

train_data_tensor = torch.tensor(train_tokens, dtype=torch.long).to(device)
train_labels_tensor = torch.tensor(train_y.values, dtype=torch.float32).to(device)
```

### Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

CNNs are feed-forward artificial neural networks. They use a variation of multilayer perceptrons that offer minimal preprocessing. Use of CNNs in NLP is a relatively new technique as previously their primary use case was in computer vision.


### Recursive neural network (RNN)

In RNN the nodes of the network form a directed graph along with a temporal sequence. Each individual input of the sequence is


### LSTM

    def __init__(self, max_len, vocab_size, hidden_size, out_size):

        # global max pooling
        max_pool, _ = torch.max(h_lstm2, 1)
        
        h_conc = torch.cat((max_pool, avg_pool), 1)
        h_conc_linear1  = F.relu(self.linear1(h_conc))
        h_conc_linear2  = F.relu(self.linear2(h_conc))
